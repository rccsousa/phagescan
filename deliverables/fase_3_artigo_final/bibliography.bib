The first section of the chapter presents the basic concepts of fault diagnosis and contextualizes them in an increasingly complex industrial sector. In the second section, the main methods currently used to solve diagnostic problems are discussed. The third section examines the major limitations of fault diagnosis, along with the main desirable characteristics of a fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) system. Finally, the fourth section presents the steps to be followed when developing a diagnostic system and shows how to choose the best method to be implemented.}
